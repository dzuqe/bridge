Warning: this contract hasn't been through a formal audit. Please use at your own risk.

A public storage contract is available on Polygon but we cannot build a contract with Algorand considering the data structures that are available. 
We have to rely on the Oracle to save information about Algorand to Matic swaps. 

However, you still require authentication from a superuser to perform a withdrawal (ie available user interface).
